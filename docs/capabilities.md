# Capabilities and limitations

This page states what the current build of Exposition actually does, per
format and per subsystem, and what it does not do. Every "Yes" is backed by an
automated test that drives the real application (`npm run e2e`) or the real
toolchain (`cargo test`); nothing here describes planned work.

Status: local alpha. Windows 11 (x64) is the verified platform. macOS and
Linux builds are structurally supported but **unverified**.

## Document formats

Each format is judged separately for source editing, building and export,
navigation between source and pages, and direct editing on the final pages.

| | Typst | Markdown | LaTeX (pdfLaTeX) | LaTeX (LuaLaTeX) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Source editing (Monaco, shared undo) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Build from unsaved buffers | Yes, in-process (Typst 0.15.1) | Yes, through the print profile `exposition-markdown-print/1` (laid out by Typst) | Yes (TeX Live; requires a trusted folder) | Yes (TeX Live; requires a trusted folder) |
| Diagnostics linked to source | Yes | Yes (Markdown ranges, incl. unsupported-math markers) | Yes (line level, from the log) | Yes (line level, from the log) |
| Last good pages kept when a build fails | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| PDF export from the same layout | Yes | Yes | Yes (the build's own PDF) | Yes (the build's own PDF) |
| Source ↔ page navigation | Character level | Character level | Character level for mapped text; line level (SyncTeX) otherwise | Same as pdfLaTeX |
| Direct editing on the page: prose | Yes | Yes | Yes (mapped text) | Yes (mapped text) |
| Direct editing on the page: an equation token | Yes | Yes (declared LaTeX-math subset) | Yes | Yes |
| Reflow, shared undo with the source editor, Split view | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Typical edit-to-page time (debug build, Ryzen 7 9800X3D) | ~2–15 ms | ~16–26 ms | ~0.3–0.45 s | ~0.8–1 s |

### What cannot be edited on the page

Text that the compiler or a template generates (numbering, references,
citations, bibliography entries, list markers, footnote marks, hyphens
inserted by line breaking), text produced by code or macros (Typst code
expressions, `#let` and function bodies, loops, `#set`, imported modules and
`#show` rule replacements; LaTeX user macros), raw/verbatim text, and content
from packages is shown with a "not editable here — edit in source" message.
Content written in place stays editable, including Typst content blocks
passed to a function (captions, footnotes) and `#if` bodies.
Edits that would change document structure (for example deleting a delimiter
of `\left`/`\right`, or typing a character that would open markup) are refused
rather than guessed.

LaTeX character mapping is inferred (SyncTeX line windows, a model of the
LaTeX source, and alignment with the PDF's glyphs) and checked glyph by glyph;
text it cannot map is not editable on the page. Exotic catcode changes and
packages that rewrite text (e.g. `siunitx`, `cleveref` names, TikZ) stay
source-only.

When you type a character that is special in LaTeX, the page editor inserts
its escaped form (`\&`, `\textless{}`, `\textasciitilde{}`, ...). pdfLaTeX's
default font encoding has no straight double quote, so a typed `"` becomes
an opening or closing quote (` `` ` / `''`) in both engines. pdfLaTeX reports
non-Latin text and combining marks as LaTeX errors, listed in Problems as
when you type them in source; LuaLaTeX reports characters missing from the
font as one warning per font.

Right-to-left text can be selected, copied, and navigated on the page; in
lines that mix directions the caret is approximate exactly at a direction
boundary. Content that a Typst document includes twice is not detected as
duplicated and stays editable in both places.

If an edit arrives from elsewhere (the source editor or an agent) while you
type on the page, your keystrokes apply at the correspondingly moved
position; if the page cannot place them, typing pauses with a message naming
the text that was not applied, and nothing is applied at a guessed position.

If a TeX engine is missing or its configured path is wrong, Problems, the
status bar, and the page view say so and link to Settings → Tool locations.

Markdown mathematics uses a declared LaTeX-math subset (see
[markdown-profile.md](markdown-profile.md)); unsupported commands render as a
visible marker and a diagnostic, never silently.

## Research

| | Python | R | Julia |
|---|---|---|---|
| Discovery of installed environments | Yes | Yes (with IRkernel) | Yes (with IJulia) |
| Managed kernel sessions, run input / selection / file | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Interrupt | Yes | No — IRkernel ignores interrupts on Windows; Cancel restarts the kernel | Yes |
| Figures and tables captured as artifacts with provenance | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Insert and update a figure/table in a Typst, LaTeX, or Markdown document | Yes | Yes | Yes |

Sessions belong to one project folder and require it to be trusted; switching
or closing the folder, or revoking trust, detaches them. Agent runs use
separate sessions. Exposition never installs runtimes or packages.

## Lean

Lean files are checked with the project's own toolchain through the Lean
language server. A file is reported **Checked** only when Lean fully
elaborated exactly that text with no errors, no `sorry` (including through
imports), kernel checking enabled, and only the standard axioms (`propext`,
`Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`). Anything else gets its own status:
Incomplete (`sorry`), Checked with axioms, Relies on compiled code
(`native_decide`), Partially checked (`#exit`), Not verified, Errors. Goals
are shown as plain text; third-party infoview widgets are not executed.
Toolchains are never downloaded implicitly.

## Agents

The first provider is Anthropic's Messages API (`claude-opus-5-5` by default).
Agents use the same services as people: they read and edit documents through
the shared document service (every change is reviewable and revertible), build
documents, run Python in their own research sessions, and check Lean files.
Scope, permission profile, and budgets are enforced by the application, not by
the model, for reading, editing, creating, and deleting files and for running
commands. The API key is stored only in Windows Credential Manager.

**Known gaps (being fixed):** an independent review found that building a
document and running Python do not yet honor a task's narrowed scope or its
"file names only" consent (build diagnostics and Python output can reveal
files outside the scope), that LaTeX builds started by an agent neither ask
for approval nor respect the restricted (container) mode, and that a scope
check can be bypassed through a link inside the scope. Until these are
fixed, run agents with whole-project scope in projects you trust, and review
the approval details before approving.

A live end-to-end run against the real provider is covered by the opt-in
scenario `npm run e2e -- live-agents` (it spends API credit): it computes with
Python, edits the paper, runs a Lean check, builds, reverts through review,
cancels a running task, handles a concurrent user edit, and has an
out-of-scope read refused by the application. The default automated suite
uses a scripted development provider that release builds do not contain.

## Execution and security

- Opening a project never runs its code. Running native tools (TeX, kernels,
  Lean, commands) requires trusting the folder; system, profile, and other
  overly broad folders cannot be trusted or opened as projects.
- Trusting or revoking a folder applies at once in every view. Revoking stops
  the folder's Lean server, research kernels, LaTeX builds, and other trusted
  jobs before it completes.
- Child processes get an environment built from scratch; credential-like
  variables are refused. Logs and events are bounded and redacted.
- Trusted native code runs with your account's privileges. Exposition kills
  the process trees it starts, but processes created through system services
  (for example WMI) can outlive a job.
- Unattended agent execution uses the restricted backend: Docker with no
  network, a read-only project mount, a non-root user, and no host
  environment. It must be configured with a locally present image; Exposition
  never pulls images and never falls back to native execution.
- TeX can read any file your account can read, which is why LaTeX builds
  require trust. R and Julia kernels talk to Exposition over local loopback
  TCP with signed but unencrypted messages; Python kernels use CurveZMQ.
- Rendered pages, kernel HTML/SVG, and Lean output are displayed as inert
  content without access to application commands.

## Files

Text files in UTF-8 (with or without BOM) and UTF-16 (with BOM) are edited
byte-exactly, including CRLF line endings; files with mixed line endings open
read-only until you normalize them. Saves are atomic and never touch the
original on failure; unsaved work is recovered after a crash. Binary and
legacy-encoded files are not opened as text.

## Installation

An NSIS installer installs per user without administrator rights. The
installer is not code-signed yet, so Windows SmartScreen shows a warning.
